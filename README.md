## Notes


- Forsen's Giftbox channel: https://www.youtube.com/c/ForsensGiftboxTV
- Forked from: https://github.com/Aayzie/forsens-giftbox-lidl-extension

- For any issues/bugs you need to go to the original issues page, you may encounter it in the [Issues section](https://github.com/Aayzie/forsens-giftbox-lidl-extension/issues)

- Regarding the 'browser history' permission that this extension requires:
  - If you've noticed, when you visit another video on YouTube, it doesn't actually load a new page, but rather it just changes the url and the contents of the current page. Because of this, the extension needs to detect if the url has changed or not, so that it can detect whether the user has clicked on a different vid. This is used for updating the rich description, detecting whether it's a giftbox video or not, reinitializing the emotes on comments, etc.
